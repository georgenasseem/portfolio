# Portfolio 

#### My name is George and I am a 14 year old self taught developer. I started learning how to code since I was 11. So far I experimented in Scratch, Mindstorms, HTML, CSS, JavaSCript, Python, Arduino, C, C#, Blender, and GIT. Additionally, I am planing to learn Ethical Hacking, Cyber Security, Advenced Python, Tensorflow, Swift, C++, Unreal Engine, SQL, and Algorithm courses in the next 2 years. The reason I started programming is because I liked to create things of my own. I am tring to learn many different tools and languages as much as I can to have a wide variety of knowlede although game devoloping is my favorite.
